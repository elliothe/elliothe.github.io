  content: One paper is focus on defending the bit-flip based adversarial weight attack via weight reconstruction technique. Another one is to leverage the group lasso based non-uniform pruning to construct dynamic neural network, which could trade-off the inference accuracy and latency of running hardware on-the-fly.
