### About the Group

The mission of __Intelligent Computing Research Group__ (ICRG), a subgroup under the Advanced Computer Architecture Laboratory (ACA-Lab), is to make fundamental and groundbreaking contributions in the state-of-the-art computing infrastructures and bridge the gap between software and hardware. Members of ICRG conduct the cross-layer research which spans across algorithms, software stack, architecture, circuit, and device.



Current research interests focuses on:
- **Algorithm**
    * Efficiency in Machine Learning (机器学习的能效)
    * Security in Machine Learning (机器学习的安全)
    * Quantum Computing and its Application (量子计算及其应用)  
- **Architecture & Circuit**
    * Processing-in-Memory (存内计算/存算一体)
    * Brian-inspired Neuromorphic Computing (神经模态计算)
    * Machine Learning Aided Electronics Design Automation (机器学习辅助电子设计自动化)
- **Device**
    * Post-CMOS Emerging Devices (后CMOS新型器件)
