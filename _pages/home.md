### About the Group

The mission of __Intelligent Computing Research Group__ (ICRG), a subgroup under the Advanced Computer Architecture Laboratory (ACA-Lab), is to make fundamental and groundbreaking contributions in the state-of-the-art computing infrastructures and bridge the gap between software and hardware. Members of ICRG conduct the cross-layer research which spans across algorithms, software stack, architecture, circuit, and device.



Current research interests focuses on:
- Algorithm
    * Efficient and Secure Machine Learning  
- Architecture & Circuit
    * In-memory Computing
    * Brian-inspired Neuromorphic Computing
    * Machine Learning Aided Electronics Design Automation (ML-EDA)
- Device
    * Post-CMOS Emerging Devices
