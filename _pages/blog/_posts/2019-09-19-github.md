> Anything in `master` branch is always deployable

Read the github post <[Understanding the github flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/)> before start this tutorial.


Making changes on a repository consists following steps
* stage
* commit
* push


# Create a repository

To be added later



# Collaboration with group member

## Invite the collaborator

navigate to the setting under the repository webpage, add the collaborator as shown in the figure.

## collaborator contribute

When the collaborate contribute, they normally create a new branch.

1. Keep the `master` branch up-to-date.
```bash
$ cd </path-to-the-repository>
$ git pull
```

2. Create a new branch from the master branch, and work on it
```bash
$ git checkout -b <name-of-new-branch>
```
which is equivalent as
```bash
$ git branch <name-of-new-branch>
$ git checkout <name-of-new-branch>
```

3. working on the new feature locally, and dont forget to push it to the remote server (allow others see your code). 
```bash
$ git push origin <name-of-new-branch>
```

4. Merge the created branch to `master` branch, then delete the branch.
```bash
$ git checkout master # change to the master branch
$ git merge <name-of-new-branch>
$ git commit
$ git push
$ git branch -d <name-of-new-branch>
```

> Recommand to use [git-flow](https://github.com/nvie/gitflow/wiki/Mac-OS-X) for branch organization. Use this [tutorial](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows/gitflow-workflow) for gitflow.

* `master` branch：perform tagging and release on this branch. 
* `develop` branch: checkout from `master` branch. This branch normally won't be modified directly, instead it checkout new feature branches, then merge them back on this `develop` branch.
* `release` branch: checkout from `develop` branch. This branch is used for the test before version release, with minor bug fix. If bug fix is complicated, merge back to the develop branch then may working from other branches. After this branch is well-tested, merge it back to both develop and master branch.
* `feature` branch: checkout from `develop` branch. Every team-member host independent `feature` branches for feature development. When the development is done, merge it back to `develop` branch.
* `fix` branch: checkout from `develop` branch for bug fix. After the bug is fixed, merge it back to the develop branch, then delete this `fix` branch.
* `hotfix` branch: checkout from `master` branch for bug fix. After the bug is fixed, merge back to both `master` and `develop` branch, then delete this `hotfix` branch.


# Command to be used
Commands for branch management:
```bash
$ git branch # show local branches
$ git branch -a # show local and remote branches
$ git branch -d <name-of-new-branch> # delete the local branch
$ git branch -D <name-of-new-branch> # force delete the local branch
$ git push <remote_name> --delete <branch_name> # delete remote branch$ git push <remote_name> :<branch_name>
$ git push <remote_name> :<branch_name> # delete remote branch
```

The remote name can be shown by:
```bash
$ git remote # the remote is <origin> in github
```
